# SQL
Structured Query Language (SQL) as defined in [techtarget.com](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/SQL)

...is a standardized programming language that is used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them.
### SQL is used for the following:

- modifying database table and index structures;
- adding, updating and deleting rows of data; and
- retrieving subsets of information from within relational database management systems (RDBMSes) -- this information can be used for transaction processing, analytics applications and other applications that require communicating with a relational database.

SQL queries and other operations take the form of commands written as statements and are aggregated into programs that enable users to add, modify or retrieve data from database tables.

A table is the most basic unit of a database and consists of rows and columns of data. A single table holds records, and each record is stored in a row of the table. Tables are the most used type of database objects, or structures that hold or reference data in a relational database. Other types of database objects include the following:
